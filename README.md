# Hangman

Hangman is a Python terminal game, wich runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

Users can try to defeat the computer by identifying all of the letters in a word or predicting the word that the computer chooses at random.
Users have just six attempts before getting "hanged" and losing all of their progress.
