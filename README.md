# Hangman

Hangman is a Python terminal game, wich runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

Users can try to defeat the computer by identifying all of the letters in a word or predicting the word that the computer chooses at random.
Users have just six attempts before getting "hanged" and losing all of their progress.

# How to play

Users have six attempts before getting "hanged" and losing all of their progress.
If the user correctly guesses a letter in the word, it  will be displayed on the terminal on the line in the right word position.
In case the user loses and he cannot guess the word before finishing the six rounds a game over message will appear.
